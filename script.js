      <strong>Hi, ${userName}.</strong> Meeting you was so exciting for me, but I was also incredibly nervous. While waiting for you outside, all sorts of thoughts were racing through my headâ€”I was even practicing how to greet you properly. I had absolutely no control over how I would react when I finally saw you.<br><br>

      Then, I noticed some dogs nearby, and one of them looked familiarâ€”I recognized it from your Snap. And suddenly, you descended from the heavens, looking absolutely stunning in that green outfit. I was mesmerized.<br><br>

      And what did I end up saying? <em>"Wo pilla tumhare Snap me tha na?"</em> LOL. In my head, I was like, "<em>#@$ diya</em>"â€”and from there, everything went downhill. I couldnâ€™t even give you the flower I had brought, and things got a little awkward.<br><br>

      <strong>Anyway, touch the flower ðŸŒ¼</strong>
